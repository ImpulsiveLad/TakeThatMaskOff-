TakeThatMaskOff! is a Lethal Company mod that allows for comedy and tragedy masks to spawn whenever a masked enemy is killed.

As of 1.0.0, the dropped masks have a set value of 100 as random variables that sync up between clients are hard, and I am not very good at C#.

Updated to 1.1.0,
Mask Value can now be changed through the config

Updated to 1.2.0
Upon killing a masked, the mask is animated to fall from head height to the ground and the mask is removed from the dead masked's model
