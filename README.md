# TakeThatMaskOff-
TakeThatMaskOff! is a Lethal Company mod that allows for comedy and tragedy masks to spawn whenever a masked enemy is killed.

As of 1.0.0, the dropped masks have a set value of 100 as random variables that sync up between clients are hard, and I am not very good at C#.

Pull requests are very much appreciated as I am still learning.

Updated to 1.1.0,
Mask Value can now be changed through the config
